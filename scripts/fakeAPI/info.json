However, people around me has given me another perspective on how interesting and beautiful the science behind biology can be. \n\n This is the first time I combined my work and knowledge from my bachelor's degree with my interest in making art. I often tend to approach these aspects differently, but this project has taught me how I can combine the different perspective, something I will keep doing in the future.",
