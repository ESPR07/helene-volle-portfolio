          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I come from a small town near Oslo, Norway. I grew up with seven
            siblings in two households, something that taught me the importance
            of good relationships. Currently, I am a student living In
            Trondheim. Outside of art, I enjoy hiking, handball, cooking and
            reading, to name a few.
          </p>

          <p>
            For as long as I can remember I have been drawn to art and curious
            about different techniques, often teaching myself along the way. The
            limitless nature of art is the inspiration to my different art forms
            and styles. Creating art allows me to enter a personal bubble,
            providing a space to better understand myself as well.

          <h2>My art</h2>
          <p>
            I believe art is about evoking feelings; not controlling them. It
            should awaken whatever emotions the viewer needs or fuel a feeling
            the viewer is already experiencing. Art is personal, both for the
            artist and the viewer. I strive to create art that has the potential
            to awaken diverse emotions in different people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of my art explores humans and nature. I like to incorporate
            sustainability in my work by for example using what I already have.
            This challenges me to think outside the box for many of my projects.
            I have a strong interest in various art forms, including:

          <h2>My motivation</h2>
          <p>
            I find motivation for art every day and in everything around me,
            from strangers to trees I encounter. However, I feel most inspired
            when I am out in nature and Creating art that reflects humanity,
            nature and sustainability is what truly drives me. I primarily
            create personal art that I would be drawn to if I came across it.
            This approach is the key to producing work I truly feel proud of.
            And I believe the essence of personal connection is noticeable in my
            work.
