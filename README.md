## Highlights & Learnings

Key takeaways from the project:

- Real commissioned work  
- Firebase authentication and data usage  
- Custom admin dashboard development  
- Experience in planning and collaboration  
- Delivery under strict deadlines  

The project was intentionally built using vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** due to familiarity at the time and time constraints before learning frameworks like React.
